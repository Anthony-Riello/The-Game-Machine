# The-Game-Machine
This is a program where you can play some card games of your choice.
Included so far, that is completed, is Poker, while Black Jack is still under development.
The Poker game uses a randomizer to make sure your experience is different every time you play.
There is also an algorithm to check for duplicates.
Furthermore, there is a score keeper to see how many points you can obtain.

To start playing, execute the game runner file with the other files included in the same folder for the program to function correctly.        
Have Fun!
